# Beginner Discord Bot Workshop

Welcome to the **Beginner Discord Bot Workshop**! This workshop is designed to help you get started with building your very first Discord bot using Python (`discord.py`). By the end of this session, you'll have learned the essential concepts to build a basic bot and interact with your Discord server.

## 1. Introduction to Discord Bots

### What is a Discord Bot?

A Discord bot is an automated program that interacts with users on Discord servers. It can perform various tasks such as:

- Sending messages
- Responding to commands
- Moderating servers
- Playing music
- And more!

### Use Cases for Discord Bots

- **Moderation Bots**: Automatically delete inappropriate messages or ban users.
- **Utility Bots**: Provide server stats, manage roles, etc.
- **Game Bots**: Organize games, create mini-games, or manage tournaments.

## 2. Setting Up a Discord Bot

### Creating a Discord Account

Make sure you have a Discord account. You can create one [here](https://discord.com).

### Creating a Discord Application

1. Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click **New Application** and give your bot a name.
3. Under **Bot**, click **Add Bot** to create your bot.

### Bot Token

Your bot token is used to authenticate your bot to Discord. Never share your bot token publicly.

# Understanding `@client.event` in discord.py

In the context of a **Discord bot** using the `discord.py` library, `@client.event` is a **decorator** that marks a function as an **event handler** for specific events triggered within the Discord server (such as when the bot joins a server, receives a message, or becomes ready). The decorator is applied to a function to tell the bot to execute that function when a particular event occurs.

## What is `@client.event`?

- **`@client.event`** is a decorator used to bind a function to a specific event that the Discord bot listens for.
- The `client` object represents your Discord bot, which is used to interact with the Discord API and handle events.
- When you add `@client.event` above a function, you are telling the bot to call that function when the corresponding event occurs.

## What is an Event?

An **event** refers to something that happens within Discord that the bot can respond to. For example:
- A user sends a message in a chat.
- A new member joins a server.
- The bot finishes logging in and is ready to perform tasks.

When such an event occurs, you can define a function that will be called automatically to handle that event, like sending a welcome message when a new user joins.

## How Do Events Work in Discord Bots?

Discord bots use an **event-driven model**. This means that the bot is "waiting" for an event to happen, and when it does, the bot executes the associated event handler function. The bot doesn't continuously check for these events—it listens for them asynchronously.

### Examples of Events

Here are a few common examples of events that a Discord bot can handle:

### 1. **`on_ready` Event**
   - **What it means**: This event is triggered when the bot successfully connects to Discord and is ready to start interacting with users and servers.
   - **Use case**: You can use this event to print a message in the console or perform any initialization tasks when the bot starts.

### 2. **`on_message` Event**
   - **What it means**: This event is triggered whenever the bot receives a new message in any text channel.
   - **Use case**: This event is used to make the bot respond to specific messages or commands sent by users.

### 3. **`on_member_join` Event**
   - **What it means**: This event occurs when a new member joins the server.
   - **Use case**: You can use this event to send a welcome message to the new member.

### 4. **`on_error` Event**
   - **What it means**: This event is triggered when there is an error in the bot’s operation or event handling.
   - **Use case**: This event is useful for logging errors or handling unexpected behaviors in the bot.

## Why Are Events Important?

Events help the bot know when to perform certain actions. Without events, the bot would have to continually check for changes or specific conditions, which is inefficient and unnecessary. Instead, Discord’s event system ensures that the bot only acts when something important happens, making it more responsive and efficient.

### Real-World Example:
Imagine a **user** sending a message in a channel. When the bot detects that a message starts with a certain command (like `!hello`), it triggers the `on_message` event and sends a response. This event-driven system allows the bot to react to specific actions automatically, rather than continuously checking for messages.

## Types of Events

Here’s a list of some common events that Discord bots can listen for:
- **`on_ready`**: Bot has successfully logged in and is ready.
- **`on_message`**: Bot received a new message in a text channel.
- **`on_member_join`**: A new member joined the server.
- **`on_member_leave`**: A member left the server.
- **`on_error`**: An error occurred in any of the event handlers.
- **`on_reaction_add`**: A user adds a reaction to a message.
- **`on_reaction_remove`**: A user removes a reaction from a message.


# Understanding Async and Sync Programming

## What is Synchronous (Sync) Programming?

In **synchronous programming**, tasks are executed one after another, in sequence. The program will execute each line of code and wait for each operation to complete before moving on to the next.

### Example:

```python
# Synchronous Example

print("Starting Task 1")
task1 = task_1()  # Waits for Task 1 to complete before moving on
print("Task 1 complete")

print("Starting Task 2")
task2 = task_2()  # Waits for Task 2 to complete before moving on
print("Task 2 complete")
```

In this example, the program will wait for `task_1()` to finish before printing `Task 1 complete` and moving on to `task_2()`.

### Problem with Sync:

In a synchronous system, if a task takes a long time (like making a network request or reading from a file), it **blocks** the program’s execution. This can lead to inefficiencies, especially if your program has to handle many tasks that involve waiting.

---

## What is Asynchronous (Async) Programming?

In **asynchronous programming**, tasks can be executed independently without waiting for the previous one to finish. This allows a program to handle multiple tasks at the same time, or at least start new tasks before waiting for the old ones to complete. In async programming, tasks are typically handled using callbacks, promises, or async/await mechanisms.

### Key Characteristics:
- The program **doesn't wait** for a task to finish before moving to the next one.
- Tasks that take time (e.g., I/O operations, network requests) can be executed in parallel or in a non-blocking manner.

### Example:

```python
# Asynchronous Example

import asyncio

async def task_1():
    print("Starting Task 1")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulates a long task
    print("Task 1 complete")

async def task_2():
    print("Starting Task 2")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulates a shorter task
    print("Task 2 complete")

async def main():
    # Run both tasks concurrently
    await asyncio.gather(task_1(), task_2())

# Start the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Explanation:
- `await asyncio.sleep(2)` simulates an asynchronous operation, like making a network request. The program doesn't wait for the task to finish. Instead, it runs other tasks while waiting.
- `asyncio.gather()` allows running multiple tasks concurrently.

In the above example, **both tasks run concurrently**, and the program doesn’t need to wait for one task to finish before starting the next.

### Benefits of Async:
- Async programming allows your program to be **non-blocking**. If you have tasks that involve waiting (e.g., I/O tasks like reading a file or making an HTTP request), async lets you continue other tasks in the meantime.
- It’s more **efficient** when working with tasks that take time and don’t need to run one after another.

---

## When to Use Async vs Sync?

### Use Synchronous:
- When tasks are quick and not dependent on waiting for external resources.
- When you want the program to execute tasks one after another, in order.

### Use Asynchronous:
- When tasks involve waiting for external resources (e.g., network requests, file I/O).
- When you need to handle multiple tasks at once without blocking the main execution flow (e.g., handling many users' requests, long-running background tasks).

## Async and Sync in Discord Bots

In **Discord bots** (like when using `discord.py` or `discord.js`), most tasks that interact with Discord's servers are asynchronous, such as sending messages, responding to events, or fetching data. The bot typically performs multiple actions simultaneously, such as handling multiple events or commands, which is why using `async/await` is so crucial.

### Example of Async in Discord.py:

```python
@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.content == '!hello':
        await message.channel.send('Hello!')  # This is an async task
```

In this example, `await message.channel.send('Hello!')` doesn’t block the bot. While it’s waiting for Discord to send the message, the bot can continue responding to other events or messages.
